# Chapter 1: Clean Code

## There Will Be Code
- Code is the language we ultimately express requirements with precisions

## Bad Codes
- Bad code brought company down
    - Bugs were not repaired from one release to the next
    - Load time grew and crashes increased
- Wading
    - Wade through bad code; slog through morass of hidden pitfalls
- LeBlanc's Law
    - We all said we'd go back and clean it up later: LATER EQUALS NEVER

## The Cost of Owning a Mass
- Decrease of Productivity
    - All knots, twist and tangles have to be understood before more of them can be added
- Management tends to add more staff
    - New staff are not versed in the design of system: driver productivity further towards zero

## The Grand Redesign in the Sky
- New tiger team to redesign the system
    - Old Members gone after 10 years and current ones demand redesign again
- Keep code clean is a matter of professional survival

## Attitude
- Managers may defend schedule and requirement
- Programmers defend the code with equal passion

## The Art of Clean Code
- Code-sense: look at a messy code and see options and variations

## What is Clean Code?
- Function/Method just does one thing
- Broken Window Theory: a broken window allows more window to be broken
- "Matter of fact" as opposed to "Speculative"
- Code is not clean without tests
- No duplication
- Tiny abstractions
- Readability: time spent reading vs writing i s 10 : 1
